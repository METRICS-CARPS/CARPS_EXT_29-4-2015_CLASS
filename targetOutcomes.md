# Target Outcomes
## Article ID: EXT_29_4_2015

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Hypothetical  employers’  evaluations. As  predicted, evaluators’  beliefs  about  job  candidates’  intellect—their  competence, thoughtfulness, and intelligence—depended on  the  communication  medium, F(2,  157)  =  10.81, p < .01, η2 =  .12.  As  indicated  by  the  standardized  scores  shown  in  Figure  1,  evaluators  who  heard  pitches  rated the  candidates’  intellect  more  highly  (M =  0.91, SD =  1.79) than did evaluators who read transcripts of pitches (M = −0.70, SD = 2.81), t(157) = 3.79, p < .01, 95% confidence  interval  (CI)  of  the  difference  =  [0.70,  2.51], d = 0.60.  Evaluators  who  watched  pitches  did  not  evaluate the candidates’ intellect (M = 1.09, SD = 1.80) differently than evaluators who listened to pitches, t(157) < 1. Simply adding more individuating information about a candidate through visual  cues,  such  as  physical  appearance  and nonverbal  mannerisms,  had  no  measurable  impact  on  evaluations of the candidate’s mind. Candidates’ intellect was conveyed primarily through their voice.

> Perhaps more important, evaluators who heard pitches also  reported  more  favorable  impressions  of  the  candidates—liked the candidates more and had more positive and  less  negative  impressions  of  the candidates—than  did evaluators who read pitches (M = 5.69, SD = 1.96, vs. M = 4.78, SD = 2.64), t(159) = 2.16, p = .03, 95% CI of the difference = [0.02, 1.80], d = 0.34 (see Fig. 1). Evaluators who heard pitches also reported being significantly more likely to hire the candidates (M = 4.34, SD = 2.26) than did evaluators who read exactly the same pitches (M = 3.06, SD = 3.15), t(156) = 2.49, p = .01, 95% CI of the difference = [0.22, 2.34], d = 0.40 (see Fig. 1). These results again did not appear to stem simply from having more individuating information about the candidates in the audio condition, because evaluators who watched pitches did not report more favorable impressions (M = 5.98, SD = 1.91) or an increased likelihood of hiring the candidates (M = 4.46, SD = 2.43) compared with evaluators
who heard pitches, ts < 1.
